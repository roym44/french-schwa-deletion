# Optional Schwa Deletion in French

The final paper I presented for the Opacity and Phonological Architecture (fall 2022) course. 

This paper deals with a rule-based analysis of schwa deletion in French, and includes a small experiment I conducted with French speakers.

## Project
The project includes:
- the audio recordings (in French) presented in the experiment
- the survey configuration and the data collected from it
- Dell's chapter from his book, and a short presentation format of the paper
